# README

Welcome to my blogging app!

If you're new here, please sign in first with a username and a password of your choosing:
* Your password must be between 6 and 20 characters
* Your username must be between 3 and 18 characters

If you've been here before, just sign in with your username and password.

Once you've signed in, blog away!

You can:
* **C**reate blog posts
* **R**ead blog posts
* **U**pdate blog posts
* **D**elete blog posts

If that's not cool, you can also perform **CRD** functionality on your comments(you cannot edit them because I'm trying to teach you to proofread at least a little bit)! But stay vigilant; your comment is attached to your username, so don't write mean comments on other people's posts because there is simply no anonymity here, folks.

You'll find all your blog posts on your personal blog and you'll find everyone's blog posts on your feed. You can create a new blog post anytime by clicking the button in the upper right corner that says "New Blog Post"... tricky!

Happy blogging!
